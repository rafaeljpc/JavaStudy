# GoT Java Services

This project is a Java Spring Boot Microservice with OAuth2
study project. This is based on this article [Building Scalable Container-Ready and 
Secure Microservices Using Spring Boot, Netflix OSS, and Spring 
OAuth2](https://dzone.com/articles/building-scalable-container-ready-and-secure-micro).

Thanks [Enrico Bergamo](https://github.com/enr1c091) for this tutorial and to leave de
GitHub source available.

**PS: I used PostgresSQL and multiple dataSource to separate the OAuth2 
TokenStore from GoT Service database**
